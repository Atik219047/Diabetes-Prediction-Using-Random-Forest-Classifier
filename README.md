Objective:
-The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using a Random Forest Classifier, leveraging patient health data to identify individuals at risk.

Technologies Used:

-Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
-Data Processing Libraries: Tools like Pandas and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and model training.

Workflow:
1. Data Collection: Gather and preprocess a dataset containing medical records and health metrics relevant to diabetes.
2. Feature Engineering: Identify and select key features that contribute to diabetes risk.
3. Model Training: Train the Random Forest Classifier on the processed dataset to learn patterns and make predictions.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics through cross-validation.
5. Prediction: Deploy the model to predict diabetes risk based on new patient data.
